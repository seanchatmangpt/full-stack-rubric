        "content": "Feature: API Error Handling\n  As an API consumer\n  I want proper error responses and handling\n  So that I can understand and recover from API failures gracefully\n\n  Background:\n    Given the API service is running with error handling middleware\n    And error logging and monitoring are configured\n    And I have access to make API requests\n\n  Scenario: 404 Not Found responses\n    When I send a GET request to \"/api/nonexistent/endpoint\"\n    Then the response status should be 404\n    And the response time should be less than 200ms\n    And the response content-type should be \"application/json\"\n    And the response should contain an error message\n    And the error should indicate \"endpoint not found\"\n    And a request ID should be included for tracking\n\n  Scenario: 400 Bad Request for malformed data\n    When I send a POST request to \"/api/_content/query\" with invalid JSON:\n    \"\"\"\n    { invalid json structure\n    \"\"\"\n    Then the response status should be 400\n    And the response time should be less than 150ms\n    And the response should describe the JSON parsing error\n    And specific error details should be provided\n    And no sensitive server information should be exposed\n\n  Scenario: 422 Validation errors\n    When I send a POST request to \"/api/content/create\" with data:\n    \"\"\"\n    {\n      \"title\": \"\",\n      \"content\": null,\n      \"invalidField\": \"value\"\n    }\n    \"\"\"\n    Then the response status should be 422\n    And the response should contain validation error details\n    And each field error should be specifically identified\n    And error messages should be user-friendly\n    And field-level error codes should be provided\n\n  Scenario: 429 Rate limiting responses\n    When I send 200 rapid requests to \"/api/_content/query\"\n    Then some responses should have status 429\n    And rate-limited responses should include \"Retry-After\" header\n    And the error should explain rate limiting policies\n    And rate limit reset time should be indicated\n    And legitimate requests should resume after the limit resets\n\n  Scenario: 500 Internal server errors\n    Given a server component is configured to fail\n    When I send a GET request to \"/api/_content/query\"\n    Then the response status should be 500\n    And the response time should be less than 5000ms\n    And the response should contain a generic error message\n    And internal error details should not be exposed to clients\n    And an error tracking ID should be provided\n\n  Scenario: 503 Service unavailable\n    Given the database connection is unavailable\n    When I send a GET request to \"/api/_content/query\"\n    Then the response status should be 503\n    And the response should indicate service temporarily unavailable\n    And estimated recovery time should be provided if known\n    And the service should continue accepting other requests if possible\n\n  Scenario: CORS error handling\n    When I send a cross-origin request from \"http://unauthorized-domain.com\"\n    To \"/api/_content/query\"\n    Then the request should be blocked by CORS policy\n    And appropriate CORS headers should be returned\n    And the error should indicate CORS restriction\n    And allowed origins should be properly configured\n\n  Scenario: Request timeout handling\n    Given API responses are artificially delayed beyond timeout limits\n    When I send a GET request to \"/api/_content/query/slow-endpoint\"\n    Then the response status should be 504 or connection timeout\n    And the timeout should occur within configured limits\n    And partial responses should not be returned\n    And the client should receive appropriate timeout indication\n\n  Scenario: Large request body handling\n    When I send a POST request with a 50MB body to \"/api/upload\"\n    Then the response status should be 413 or 400\n    And the response should indicate payload too large\n    And maximum allowed size should be specified\n    And the server should not process the oversized request\n    And memory usage should remain controlled\n\n  Scenario: Unsupported HTTP methods\n    When I send a DELETE request to \"/api/_content/query\"\n    Then the response status should be 405\n    And the response should indicate method not allowed\n    And the \"Allow\" header should list supported methods\n    And the error message should be clear about method restriction\n\n  Scenario: Authentication and authorization errors\n    When I send a GET request to \"/api/admin/protected\" without credentials\n    Then the response status should be 401\n    And the response should indicate authentication required\n    And authentication methods should be specified\n    And no sensitive data should be returned\n\n  Scenario: Insufficient permissions\n    Given I am authenticated as a regular user\n    When I send a DELETE request to \"/api/admin/delete/content\"\n    Then the response status should be 403\n    And the response should indicate insufficient permissions\n    And required permission levels should be specified\n    And audit logs should record the unauthorized attempt\n\n  Scenario: Error response consistency\n    When various error conditions occur across different endpoints\n    Then all error responses should follow the same format structure\n    And error codes should be consistent across the API\n    And error messages should maintain similar tone and detail level\n    And metadata like request IDs should always be included\n\n  Scenario: Error logging and monitoring\n    Given error tracking is configured\n    When various API errors occur\n    Then errors should be logged with appropriate severity levels\n    And error patterns should be identifiable in logs\n    And critical errors should trigger monitoring alerts\n    And error rates should be tracked for system health",

        "content": "Feature: API Performance Testing\n  As a system administrator and developer\n  I want to ensure APIs meet performance requirements\n  So that the application provides optimal user experience under various load conditions\n\n  Background:\n    Given the API service is running in production mode\n    And performance monitoring is enabled\n    And baseline performance metrics are established\n\n  Scenario: Single request response times\n    When I send a GET request to \"/api/_content/query\"\n    Then the response time should be less than 200ms for 95% of requests\n    And the response time should be less than 500ms for 99% of requests\n    And the response status should be 200\n    And the response should contain expected data\n\n  Scenario: Content API query performance\n    Given the content collection contains 1000+ documents\n    When I send a GET request to \"/api/_content/query/docs/getting-started\"\n    Then the response time should be less than 150ms\n    And memory usage should not increase significantly\n    And the response should be served from cache if applicable\n    And database query time should be optimized\n\n  Scenario: Raw markdown serving performance\n    When I send a GET request to \"/raw/docs/large-document.md\"\n    Then the response time should be less than 300ms for files under 1MB\n    And the response time should be less than 1000ms for files under 10MB\n    And file streaming should be used for large files\n    And memory usage should remain constant regardless of file size\n\n  Scenario: Concurrent request handling\n    When I send 50 concurrent requests to \"/api/_content/query\"\n    Then all requests should complete within 2000ms\n    And at least 95% of requests should have status 200\n    And response times should not degrade significantly under load\n    And the server should remain responsive to new requests\n\n  Scenario: Database query optimization\n    Given complex content queries with multiple filters\n    When I send a GET request to \"/api/_content/query\" with query parameters:\n      | parameter | value                    |\n      | where     | tags:$in:tutorial,guide  |\n      | sort      | date:desc                |\n      | limit     | 20                       |\n    Then the response time should be less than 400ms\n    And database query execution should be optimized\n    And appropriate indexes should be utilized\n    And query plans should be efficient\n\n  Scenario: Memory usage under load\n    Given baseline memory usage is measured\n    When I send 200 requests over 30 seconds to various API endpoints\n    Then memory usage should not increase by more than 50MB\n    And garbage collection should occur regularly\n    And memory leaks should not be present\n    And memory should return to baseline after load\n\n  Scenario: Cache effectiveness\n    Given API responses are cacheable\n    When I send the same request to \"/api/_content/query/docs/intro\" multiple times\n    Then the first request should establish cache\n    And subsequent requests should be served from cache\n    And cached responses should be faster than 50ms\n    And cache hit ratio should be above 80% for repeated requests\n\n  Scenario: API response compression\n    When I send a GET request with \"Accept-Encoding: gzip\" header\n    To \"/api/_content/query\" expecting large response\n    Then the response should be compressed with gzip\n    And compressed response should be significantly smaller\n    And decompression should not impact client performance\n    And compression ratio should be better than 3:1 for JSON\n\n  Scenario: Static asset serving performance\n    When I send requests for static assets through the API\n    Then response times should be less than 100ms for assets under 1MB\n    And appropriate cache headers should be set\n    And ETag headers should be provided for cache validation\n    And 304 Not Modified responses should be served when appropriate\n\n  Scenario: Error response performance\n    When I send requests that result in various error conditions\n    Then error responses should be faster than 100ms\n    And error handling should not consume excessive resources\n    And error logging should not impact response times\n    And error responses should be lightweight\n\n  Scenario: Load testing sustainability\n    When I maintain 100 requests per second for 5 minutes\n    Then the system should sustain the load without degradation\n    And response times should remain within acceptable limits\n    And error rates should stay below 1%\n    And system resources should remain stable\n\n  Scenario: Scalability under increasing load\n    When I gradually increase concurrent users from 10 to 500\n    Then response times should scale predictably\n    And throughput should increase proportionally with resources\n    And system should not experience sudden performance cliffs\n    And graceful degradation should occur before system limits\n\n  Scenario: Database connection pool performance\n    Given database connection pooling is configured\n    When concurrent requests require database access\n    Then connection acquisition should be faster than 10ms\n    And connection pool should not become a bottleneck\n    And connection reuse should be efficient\n    And pool exhaustion should be handled gracefully\n\n  Scenario: Content search performance\n    Given a large content collection with search functionality\n    When I send search queries to \"/api/_content/query\" with text search\n    Then search response times should be less than 800ms\n    And search results should be ranked by relevance\n    And search indexing should be optimized\n    And fuzzy search should perform within acceptable limits\n\n  Scenario: Performance monitoring and alerting\n    Given performance thresholds are configured\n    When API response times exceed defined thresholds\n    Then monitoring alerts should be triggered\n    And performance metrics should be collected continuously\n    And degradation patterns should be identifiable\n    And automated remediation should be considered",

management system is initialized\n    And search functionality is enabled\n    And I have content indexed for search\n\n  Scenario: Basic text search\n    Given I have content with various topics\n      | Title | Content |\n      | Vue Components | Learn how to build reusable Vue components |\n      | React Hooks | Understanding React hooks and state management |\n      | Node.js APIs | Building REST APIs with Node.js and Express |\n    When I search for \"Vue\"\n    Then I should see results containing \"Vue Components\"\n    And results should highlight the search term\n    And results should be ranked by relevance\n\n  Scenario: Multi-word search\n    Given I have content about web development\n    When I search for \"Vue components reusable\"\n    Then results should match content containing any of these terms\n    And exact phrase matches should rank higher\n    And partial matches should also be included\n    And search should be case-insensitive\n\n  Scenario: Search with filters\n    Given I have content in different categories\n      | Title | Category | Tags |\n      | Vue Guide | Frontend | vue, javascript, framework |\n      | API Design | Backend | api, nodejs, database |\n      | SEO Tips | Marketing | seo, content, optimization |\n    When I search for \"javascript\" \n    And I filter by category \"Frontend\"\n    Then only frontend content matching \"javascript\" should appear\n    And filter options should be visible\n    And active filters should be clearly indicated\n\n  Scenario: Search autocomplete and suggestions\n    Given I have a search index built\n    When I start typing \"vue comp\"\n    Then autocomplete suggestions should appear\n    And suggestions should include \"vue components\"\n    And I should be able to select suggestions with keyboard or mouse\n    And recent searches should be included in suggestions\n\n  Scenario: Search result pagination\n    Given I have 50 pieces of content matching my search\n    And search results show 10 items per page\n    When I search for a common term\n    Then I should see 10 results on page 1\n    And pagination controls should show 5 pages\n    And I should be able to navigate between pages\n    And search term should persist across pages\n\n  Scenario: Advanced search operators\n    Given I want to perform complex searches\n    When I search with quotes: \"vue components\"\n    Then only exact phrase matches should appear\n    When I search with exclusion: \"vue -react\"\n    Then results should contain \"vue\" but not \"react\"\n    When I search with wildcards: \"compon*\"\n    Then results should match \"component\", \"components\", etc.\n\n  Scenario: Search by content type\n    Given I have different types of content\n      | Title | Type | Content |\n      | Vue Tutorial | Article | Step-by-step Vue guide |\n      | API Video | Video | Video about REST APIs |\n      | Code Snippet | Code | Vue component example |\n    When I filter search by type \"Article\"\n    Then only article content should appear in results\n    And type filters should be mutually exclusive\n    And content type should be clearly indicated in results\n\n  Scenario: Search within specific sections\n    Given I have content with multiple sections\n    When I search for \"components\" within \"Frontend\" section\n    Then only frontend content should be searched\n    And results should be scoped to that section\n    And section context should be shown in results\n\n  Scenario: Search result previews\n    Given I have search results displayed\n    When I view the results list\n    Then each result should show a content preview\n    And preview should include the search term in context\n    And preview should be limited to 2-3 lines\n    And full content should be accessible via click\n\n  Scenario: Search performance and indexing\n    Given I have a large content database with 1000+ items\n    When I perform a search query\n    Then results should appear within 500ms\n    And the search index should be up to date\n    And recently added content should be immediately searchable\n\n  Scenario: Search analytics and insights\n    Given search tracking is enabled\n    When users perform searches\n    Then popular search terms should be tracked\n    And \"no results\" queries should be logged\n    And search patterns should inform content creation\n\n  Scenario: Voice search support\n    Given voice search is enabled\n    When I use voice input to search\n    Then speech should be converted to text\n    And search should be performed on the converted text\n    And voice search should work across different browsers\n\n  Scenario: Search export and sharing\n    Given I have search results I want to share\n    When I perform a search with specific filters\n    Then I should be able to copy a shareable URL\n    And the URL should preserve search terms and filters\n    And others should see the same results when visiting the URL\n\n  Scenario: Typo tolerance and fuzzy search\n    Given I have content about \"components\"\n    When I search for \"componants\" (with typo)\n    Then the system should suggest \"components\"\n    And results for \"components\" should be shown\n    And the correction should be clearly indicated\n\n  Scenario: Search within results\n    Given I have search results displayed\n    When I want to further narrow down results\n    Then I should be able to search within current results\n    And the refined search should maintain original context\n    And I should be able to clear the refinement\n\n  Scenario: Saved searches and alerts\n    Given I frequently search for certain terms\n    When I save a search query\n    Then it should be accessible from my profile\n    And I should be able to set up alerts for new matching content\n    And alerts should be delivered via notification or email\n\n  Scenario: Search accessibility\n    Given I am using assistive technology\n    When I use the search functionality\n    Then search inputs should have proper labels\n    And results should be announced to screen readers\n    And keyboard navigation should work throughout search interface\n    And high contrast mode should be supported",

application has global error handling\n    When any unhandled errors occur\n    Then all errors should be caught by the global error handler\n    And error reporting should include stack traces and context\n    And user sessions should be preserved when possible\n    And critical errors should trigger incident response\n    And error frequency should be monitored and alerting configured\n    And error patterns should be analyzed for proactive fixes\n\n  @error-handling @recovery @high\n  Scenario: Error Recovery and Resilience\n    Given errors have occurred in the application\n    When recovery mechanisms are triggered\n    Then application state should be restored to a stable condition\n    And users should be guided through recovery steps\n    And data integrity should be maintained during recovery\n    And recovery success rate should be >= 95%\n    And recovery time should be <= 5 seconds for most errors\n    And users should be informed about recovery progress\n\n  @error-handling @monitoring @high\n  Scenario: Error Monitoring and Alerting\n    Given error monitoring is configured\n    When errors occur in production\n    Then errors should be tracked with unique identifiers\n    And error rates should be monitored and alerted (threshold: >1% error rate)\n    And critical errors should trigger immediate alerts\n    And error trends should be analyzed for pattern detection\n    And error context should include user agent, URL, and user actions\n    And error resolution should be tracked and measured",

        "content": "Feature: Real-time Typing Feedback\n  As a user practicing typing\n  I want to receive immediate visual feedback on my typing\n  So that I can correct mistakes and improve my accuracy in real-time\n\n  Background:\n    Given I am on the typing tutor page\n    And a coding exercise with the text \"const greeting = 'Hello World';\" is loaded\n\n  Scenario: Visual feedback for correct characters\n    Given I have started typing\n    When I type \"c\" correctly\n    Then the \"c\" in the target text should be highlighted in green\n    And the next character \"o\" should be highlighted with a cursor indicator\n    And the visual feedback should appear instantly\n\n  Scenario: Visual feedback for incorrect characters\n    Given I have started typing\n    When I type \"x\" instead of \"c\"\n    Then the \"c\" in the target text should be highlighted in red\n    And the next character \"o\" should still be highlighted with a cursor indicator\n    And the incorrect character should be visually distinct\n\n  Scenario: Cursor position indicator\n    Given I have typed \"const\" correctly\n    When I am about to type the next character\n    Then the space character should be highlighted with a blue background\n    And only one character should have the cursor indicator at a time\n    And the cursor should advance as I type\n\n  Scenario: Mixed correct and incorrect feedback\n    Given I have started typing\n    When I type \"xonst\" (first letter wrong, rest correct)\n    Then the first \"c\" should be highlighted in red\n    And the \"o\", \"n\", \"s\", \"t\" should be highlighted in green\n    And the cursor should be on the space character\n\n  Scenario: Real-time error highlighting\n    Given I am typing the word \"greeting\"\n    When I type \"greating\" (with an extra \"a\")\n    Then each character should be colored as I type it\n    And incorrect characters should immediately show in red\n    And correct characters should immediately show in green\n    And the highlighting should not lag behind my typing\n\n  Scenario: Feedback during backspace corrections\n    Given I have typed \"xonst\" with the first character wrong\n    When I backspace to remove the \"x\"\n    Then the red highlighting should be removed from that position\n    And the cursor indicator should move back to the first character\n    And I should be able to see where to type the correct character\n\n  Scenario: Whitespace and special character feedback\n    Given the target text contains spaces, equals signs, and quotes\n    When I type these special characters correctly\n    Then spaces should be highlighted (though less visibly)\n    And quotes and equals signs should be highlighted in green\n    And special characters should receive the same feedback treatment\n\n  Scenario: Newline and indentation feedback\n    Given the target text contains newlines and indentation\n    When I press Enter to create a new line\n    Then the newline should be highlighted as correct\n    And the cursor should move to the beginning of the next line\n    And indentation spaces should be highlighted as I type them\n\n  Scenario: Error count visual update\n    Given I have made some typing errors\n    When my error count increases\n    Then the error count display should update immediately\n    And the error count should be visually prominent (red color)\n    And each new error should increment the count in real-time\n\n  Scenario: Accuracy percentage visual feedback\n    Given I am typing and making some mistakes\n    When my accuracy drops below 95%\n    Then the accuracy percentage should update in real-time\n    And accuracy should be color-coded (green for good accuracy)\n    And the percentage should be calculated and displayed immediately\n\n  Scenario: Progress bar visual feedback\n    Given I am typing through the exercise\n    When I reach 50% completion\n    Then the progress bar should fill to 50%\n    And the progress bar should animate smoothly\n    And the animation should have a 300ms transition duration\n\n  Scenario: Completion visual feedback\n    Given I am nearing the end of the exercise\n    When I type the final character correctly\n    Then all characters should be highlighted in green\n    And the completion modal should appear immediately\n    And the typing area should be visually disabled\n\n  Scenario: Color accessibility\n    Given I am using the typing tutor\n    When viewing the color-coded feedback\n    Then green should be used for correct characters\n    And red should be used for incorrect characters\n    And blue should be used for the cursor position\n    And the colors should have sufficient contrast for accessibility\n\n  Scenario: Font and typography feedback\n    Given the typing exercise is displayed\n    When viewing the target text\n    Then a monospace font should be used for alignment\n    And the font size should be large enough to read easily (18px or larger)\n    And the text should have proper line spacing\n    And code formatting should be preserved",

        "content": "Feature: Monaco Editor Integration\n  As a user practicing typing code\n  I want to use Monaco editor features for a better coding experience\n  So that I can practice typing with professional code editor functionality\n\n  Background:\n    Given I am on the typing tutor page\n    And the Monaco editor component is available\n    And a JavaScript exercise is loaded\n\n  Scenario: Monaco editor initialization\n    Given the typing tutor page has loaded\n    When the Monaco editor component is initialized\n    Then it should display in a dark theme\n    And it should use JavaScript language mode\n    And it should have syntax highlighting enabled\n    And it should use a monospace font\n\n  Scenario: Syntax highlighting in target text\n    Given a JavaScript exercise is loaded in Monaco\n    When the target text contains keywords, strings, and functions\n    Then JavaScript keywords should be highlighted in blue\n    And string literals should be highlighted in green\n    And comments should be highlighted in gray\n    And functions should be highlighted appropriately\n    And the syntax highlighting should match professional editors\n\n  Scenario: Code formatting preservation\n    Given the target text contains proper JavaScript indentation\n    When displayed in Monaco editor\n    Then indentation should be preserved exactly\n    And code blocks should maintain their structure\n    And bracket matching should be visually indicated\n    And line numbers should be displayed if enabled\n\n  Scenario: Monaco editor typing integration\n    Given the Monaco editor is ready for input\n    When I start typing in the Monaco editor\n    Then the typing should feel natural and responsive\n    And cursor movement should be smooth\n    And character insertion should work correctly\n    And the editor should handle special characters properly\n\n  Scenario: Language-specific features\n    Given Monaco is configured for JavaScript\n    When displaying code content\n    Then it should recognize JavaScript syntax patterns\n    And it should provide appropriate syntax highlighting\n    And it should handle JavaScript-specific characters like backticks\n    And it should properly format template literals\n\n  Scenario: Editor theming and appearance\n    Given Monaco editor is initialized\n    When viewing the editor interface\n    Then it should use the VS Code dark theme\n    And the background should be dark (gray-900 equivalent)\n    And text should be light colored for contrast\n    And the theme should match the overall application design\n\n  Scenario: Read-only mode for target text\n    Given the target text is displayed in Monaco\n    When the editor shows the text to be typed\n    Then the target text editor should be read-only\n    And users should not be able to edit the target text\n    And the target text should be clearly distinguishable from input area\n    And selection should be disabled in the target text\n\n  Scenario: Input area Monaco configuration\n    Given there is a Monaco editor for user input\n    When I interact with the input editor\n    Then it should be fully editable\n    And it should support all standard text editing operations\n    And it should provide real-time feedback on typing\n    And it should integrate with the typing metrics system\n\n  Scenario: Monaco performance with typing metrics\n    Given Monaco editor is handling typing input\n    When I type at normal speed (40+ WPM)\n    Then the editor should remain responsive\n    And syntax highlighting should not cause lag\n    And typing metrics should update in real-time\n    And there should be no noticeable performance degradation\n\n  Scenario: Multi-line code handling\n    Given the exercise contains multi-line JavaScript code\n    When displayed in Monaco editor\n    Then line breaks should be preserved correctly\n    And indentation should be maintained across lines\n    And the editor should handle Enter key presses properly\n    And code structure should remain intact\n\n  Scenario: Special character handling in Monaco\n    Given the code contains JavaScript special characters\n    When typing characters like {}[]();\"'\n    Then Monaco should handle these characters correctly\n    And bracket matching should work if enabled\n    And string delimiters should be handled properly\n    And escape sequences should display correctly\n\n  Scenario: Monaco editor accessibility\n    Given Monaco editor is being used\n    When accessed by users with different needs\n    Then the editor should support keyboard navigation\n    And text should have sufficient contrast\n    And screen readers should be able to access the content\n    And font size should be appropriate for readability\n\n  Scenario: Integration with typing feedback system\n    Given Monaco editor is integrated with typing feedback\n    When I type correct and incorrect characters\n    Then Monaco should support the color highlighting system\n    And correct characters should appear in green\n    And incorrect characters should appear in red\n    And the cursor position should be clearly indicated\n\n  Scenario: Monaco editor error handling\n    Given Monaco editor encounters an initialization error\n    When the editor fails to load\n    Then the system should gracefully fall back to a textarea\n    And typing functionality should still work\n    And users should be informed of the degraded experience\n    And all core typing features should remain functional\n\n  Scenario: Editor configuration flexibility\n    Given Monaco editor can be configured\n    When setting up for different code types\n    Then the language mode should be configurable\n    And the theme should be adjustable\n    And editor options should be customizable\n    And the configuration should persist during the session",

gradually improve my coding typing skills\n\n  Background:\n    Given I am on the typing tutor page\n    And multiple exercises are available with different difficulty levels\n\n  Scenario: Initial exercise selection\n    Given I am starting the typing tutor for the first time\n    When the page loads\n    Then the first exercise should be loaded automatically\n    And it should be a \"Basic JavaScript\" exercise\n    And it should be marked as \"easy\" difficulty\n    And the exercise code should be displayed in the target area\n\n  Scenario: Exercise difficulty levels\n    Given there are multiple exercises available\n    When I review the available exercises\n    Then there should be \"easy\" exercises with basic syntax\n    And there should be \"medium\" exercises with more complex code\n    And there should be \"hard\" exercises with advanced patterns\n    And each exercise should have a clear difficulty indicator\n\n  Scenario: Progressing to next exercise\n    Given I have completed the current exercise successfully\n    When I click the \"Next Exercise\" button\n    Then the next exercise in the sequence should load\n    And the target text should update to the new exercise\n    And all metrics should reset for the new exercise\n    And the exercise title and description should update\n\n  Scenario: Next button availability\n    Given I am working on an exercise\n    When the exercise is not yet complete\n    Then the \"Next Exercise\" button should be disabled\n    And when I complete the exercise\n    Then the \"Next Exercise\" button should become enabled\n\n  Scenario: Exercise cycling\n    Given I have completed all available exercises\n    When I click \"Next Exercise\" on the last exercise\n    Then the system should cycle back to the first exercise\n    And I should be able to practice exercises repeatedly\n    And the cycling should be seamless\n\n  Scenario: Exercise categories\n    Given exercises are organized by programming concepts\n    When I view the available exercises\n    Then there should be exercises for \"javascript\" category\n    And exercises should cover \"variables and functions\"\n    And exercises should cover \"array methods\"\n    And exercises should cover \"async operations\"\n\n  Scenario: Exercise content variety\n    Given I am practicing different exercises\n    When I progress through the exercises\n    Then \"Basic JavaScript\" should include simple variable declarations\n    And \"Array Methods\" should include map, filter, and reduce operations\n    And \"Async Operations\" should include promises and async/await\n    And each exercise should represent realistic code patterns\n\n  Scenario: Difficulty progression validation\n    Given I start with an easy exercise\n    When I progress to the next exercises\n    Then the character count should generally increase\n    And the code complexity should increase\n    And special characters usage should increase\n    And indentation complexity should increase\n\n  Scenario: Exercise reset within progression\n    Given I am working on any exercise in the progression\n    When I click the \"Reset\" button\n    Then only the current exercise should reset\n    And my progress through the exercise sequence should be maintained\n    And I should remain on the same exercise\n\n  Scenario: Exercise metadata display\n    Given an exercise is loaded\n    When I view the exercise information\n    Then the exercise title should be displayed\n    And the difficulty level should be visible\n    And the category should be shown\n    And a brief description should be available\n\n  Scenario: Completion modal with progression info\n    Given I complete an exercise\n    When the completion modal appears\n    Then it should show my performance metrics\n    And it should offer to advance to the next exercise\n    And the \"Next Exercise\" button should be prominently displayed\n    And I should be able to close the

Background:\n    Given I am on the application homepage\n\n  @components @buttons\n  Scenario Outline: Button component interactions\n    Given I see a \"<button_type>\" button with text \"<button_text>\"\n    When I \"<interaction>\" the button\n    Then the button should provide appropriate visual feedback\n    And the button should execute its intended action\n    And the button should return to normal state after interaction\n\n    Examples:\n      | button_type | button_text    | interaction |\n      | primary     | Start Practice | click       |\n      | secondary   | View Results   | click       |\n      | danger      | Reset Progress | click       |\n      | primary     | Start Practice | hover       |\n      | secondary   | View Results   | focus       |\n\n  @components @loading-states\n  Scenario: Loading states for async operations\n    Given I click on a button that triggers an async operation\n    When the operation is in progress\n    Then the button should show a loading indicator\n    And the button should be disabled to prevent duplicate clicks\n    And I should see appropriate loading text or spinner\n    When the operation completes successfully\n    Then the loading state should clear\n    And the button should return to normal state\n\n  @components @modals\n  Scenario: Modal dialog behavior\n    Given I click on a button that opens a modal\n    When the modal opens\n    Then the modal should appear with smooth animation\n    And the background should be dimmed with an overlay\n    And focus should be trapped within the modal\n    When I press the \"Escape\" key\n    Then the modal should close\n    When I click outside the modal content\n    Then the modal should close\n    When I click the close button\n    Then the modal should close\n\n  @components @tooltips\n  Scenario: Tooltip interactions\n    Given I hover over an element with a tooltip\n    Then the tooltip should appear after a brief delay\n    And the tooltip should be positioned appropriately\n    And the tooltip text should be readable\n    When I move my cursor away\n    Then the tooltip should disappear\n    When I focus the element with keyboard\n    Then the tooltip should also appear\n\n  @components @dropdown-menus\n  Scenario: Dropdown menu functionality\n    Given I see a dropdown menu trigger\n    When I click on the dropdown trigger\n    Then the dropdown menu should open\n    And menu items should be visible and clickable\n    When I click on a menu item\n    Then the dropdown should close\n    And the selected action should execute\n    When I click outside the dropdown\n    Then the dropdown should close without selecting\n\n  @components @tabs\n  Scenario: Tab navigation component\n    Given I see a tab component with multiple tabs\n    When I click on a non-active tab\n    Then the tab should become active\n    And the corresponding content should be displayed\n    And the previous tab should become inactive\n    When I use arrow keys to navigate tabs\n    Then focus should move between tab headers\n    When I press \"Enter\" or \"Space\" on a focused tab\n    Then that tab should become active\n\n  @components @accordion\n  Scenario: Accordion expand and collapse\n    Given I see an accordion component\n    When I click on an accordion header\n    Then the accordion panel should expand with animation\n    And the accordion icon should indicate expanded state\n    When I click on the same header again\n    Then the accordion panel should collapse\n    And the accordion icon should indicate collapsed state\n\n  @components @progress-indicators\n  Scenario: Progress indicator updates\n    Given I start a typing practice session\n    When I begin typing\n    Then the progress bar should update in real-time\n    And the percentage should be accurate\n    And the visual indicator should be smooth\n    When I complete the practice\n    Then the progress should show 100%\n    And completion state should be clearly indicated\n\n  @components @notifications\n  Scenario Outline: Notification system\n    Given a \"<notification_type>\" notification appears\n    Then it should have appropriate styling for the type\n    And it should be positioned in the notification area\n    And it should auto-dismiss after \"<duration>\" seconds if not persistent\n    When I click the notification close button\n    Then the notification should dismiss immediately\n\n    Examples:\n      | notification_type | duration |\n      | success          | 3        |\n      | error            | 5        |\n      | warning          | 4        |\n      | info             | 3        |\n\n  @components @search-autocomplete\n  Scenario: Search with autocomplete\n    Given I focus on the search input field\n    When I type \"typ\" in the search box\n    Then autocomplete suggestions should appear\n    And suggestions should be relevant to my input\n    When I press the \"Down\" arrow key\n    Then the first suggestion should be highlighted\n    When I press \"Enter\"\n    Then the highlighted suggestion should be selected\n\n  @components @data-tables\n  Scenario: Data table interactions\n    Given I see a data table with typing statistics\n    When I click on a column header\n    Then the table should sort by that column\n    And the sort indicator should show the direction\n    When I click the same header again\n    Then the sort order should reverse\n    When I use the pagination controls\n    Then the table should load the next set of data\n\n  @components @mobile-components\n  Scenario: Component behavior on mobile devices\n    Given I am using a mobile browser with viewport \"375x667\"\n    When I interact with touch-enabled components\n    Then touch targets should be appropriately sized\n    And touch feedback should be immediate\n    And swipe gestures should work where applicable\n    And components should adapt to touch interactions\n\n  @components @keyboard-navigation\n  Scenario: Keyboard navigation through components\n    Given I am using keyboard navigation\n    When I press \"Tab\" repeatedly\n    Then focus should move logically through components\n    And focus indicators should be clearly visible\n    And all interactive elements should be reachable\n    When I use arrow keys within component groups\n    Then navigation should work appropriately for the component type\n\n  @components @error-states\n  Scenario: Component error states\n    Given a component encounters an error condition\n    When the error occurs\n    Then the component should display appropriate error styling\n    And error messages should be clear and helpful\n    And the component should provide recovery options where possible\n    And error states should be accessible to screen readers\n\n  @components @disabled-states\n  Scenario: Disabled component states\n    Given a component is in a disabled state\n    Then it should have appropriate visual styling\n    And it should not respond to user interactions\n    And it should be properly labeled for accessibility\n    And disabled state should be indicated to screen readers\n\n  @components @responsive-behavior\n  Scenario Outline: Component responsive behavior\n    Given I am viewing components on a \"<device_type>\" with viewport \"<viewport>\"\n    When I interact with various UI components\n    Then components should adapt their size and layout appropriately\n    And functionality should remain intact across all screen sizes\n    And touch interactions should work properly on touch devices\n\n    Examples:\n      | device_type | viewport   |\n      | desktop     | 1920x1080 |\n      | tablet      | 768x1024  |\n      | mobile      | 375x667   |\n\n  @components @animation-states\n  Scenario: Component animations and transitions\n    Given I interact with animated components\n    When state changes occur\n    Then animations should be smooth and purposeful\n    And animations should complete within reasonable time\n    And animations should respect user motion preferences\n    And components should remain functional during animations",

appropriate for readability\n    And headings should scale proportionally\n    And the typing interface text should be clearly visible\n\n    Examples:\n      | viewport    | font_size |\n      | 1920x1080  | 16px      |\n      | 1366x768   | 16px      |\n      | 768x1024   | 16px      |\n      | 375x667    | 16px      |\n      | 320x568    | 16px      |\n\n  @responsive @images\n  Scenario: Responsive image handling\n    Given I am on a page with images\n    When I view the page on different screen sizes\n    Then images should scale appropriately\n    And high-resolution images should be served to high-DPI screens\n    And images should not cause horizontal scrolling\n    And lazy loading should work on mobile devices\n\n  @responsive @grid-layout\n  Scenario: CSS Grid and Flexbox responsiveness\n    Given I am viewing a page with grid layouts\n    When I resize the browser window\n    Then grid items should reflow appropriately\n    And flexbox containers should adapt\n    And no layout breaks should occur\n    And the typing practice grid should remain functional\n\n  @responsive @touch-interactions\n  Scenario: Touch-specific interactions on mobile\n    Given I am using a touch device with viewport \"375x667\"\n    Then tap targets should be minimum \"44px\" square\n    And hover states should be replaced with active states\n    And scroll areas should have momentum scrolling\n    And pinch-to-zoom should work where appropriate\n\n  @responsive @performance\n  Scenario Outline: Performance across device types\n    Given I am using a \"<device_type>\" browser with

environments\n\n  Background:\n    Given I am on the application homepage\n\n  @theme @light-mode\n  Scenario: Default light theme appearance\n    Given the application loads with default settings\n    Then I should see the light theme active\n    And the background should be light colored\n    And text should be dark for good contrast\n    And the theme toggle should show \"Dark Mode\" option\n\n  @theme @dark-mode\n  Scenario: Switch to dark theme\n    Given I am using the light theme\n    When I click on the theme toggle button\n    Then the theme should switch to dark mode\n    And the background should be dark colored\n    And text should be light for good contrast\n    And the theme toggle should show \"Light Mode\" option\n    And the transition should be smooth without flickering\n\n  @theme @system-preference\n  Scenario: Respect system theme preference\n    Given my system is set to dark mode\n    When I visit the application for the first time\n    Then the dark theme should be automatically applied\n    And the theme preference should be saved\n    When my system switches to light mode\n    And I refresh the page\n    Then the theme should switch to light mode if no user preference is set\n\n  @theme @persistence\n  Scenario: Theme preference persistence\n    Given I have switched to dark theme\n    When I refresh the page\n    Then the dark theme should remain active\n    When I close and reopen the browser\n    Then the dark theme should still be active\n    When I visit the site on a different tab\n    Then the dark theme should be consistent\n\n  @theme @mobile-theme\n  Scenario: Theme switching on mobile devices\n    Given I am using a mobile browser with viewport \"375x667\"\n    When I access the theme toggle in the mobile menu\n    Then I should be able to switch themes\n    And the mobile interface should adapt to the new theme\n    And all mobile-specific elements should respect the theme\n\n  @theme @accessibility-contrast\n  Scenario Outline: Color contrast accessibility in themes\n    Given I am using the \"<theme>\" theme\n    Then all text should meet WCAG AA contrast requirements\n    And interactive elements should have sufficient contrast\n    And focus indicators should be clearly visible\n    And error states should be distinguishable\n\n    Examples:\n      | theme |\n      | light |\n      | dark  |\n\n  @theme @typing-interface\n  Scenario: Theme application to typing interface\n    Given I am on the typing practice page\n    When I switch between light and dark themes\n    Then the typing area background should adapt appropriately\n    And the text being typed should have good contrast\n    And syntax highlighting should work in both themes\n    And the cursor should be clearly visible in both themes\n\n  @theme @component-theming\n  Scenario Outline: Individual component theme adaptation\n    Given I am viewing the \"<component>\" component\n    When I switch to \"<theme>\" theme\n    Then the component should adapt its colors appropriately\n    And borders and shadows should match the theme\n    And hover states should work correctly\n    And any icons should be theme-appropriate\n\n    Examples:\n      | component      | theme |\n      | navigation     | dark  |\n      | navigation     | light |\n      | typing-editor  | dark  |\n      | typing-editor  | light |\n      | settings-panel | dark  |\n      | settings-panel | light |\n      | progress-chart | dark  |\n      | progress-chart | light |\n\n  @theme @high-contrast\n  Scenario: High contrast theme for accessibility\n    Given I have vision accessibility needs\n    When I enable high contrast mode in my system\n    Then the application should detect this preference\n    And apply a high contrast theme variant\n    And all elements should have maximum contrast\n    And decorative elements should be minimized\n\n  @theme @custom-themes\n  Scenario: Custom theme creation\n    Given I am in the settings page\n    When I access the theme customization options\n    Then I should be able to select custom colors\n    And preview the changes in real-time\n    When I save my custom theme\n    Then it should be applied immediately\n    And saved for future visits\n\n  @theme @animation-transitions\n  Scenario: Smooth theme transitions\n    Given I am on any page\n    When I toggle the theme\n    Then the transition should take no more than 0.3 seconds\n    And all elements should transition smoothly\n    And no elements should flicker or jump\n    And animations should respect user motion preferences\n\n  @theme @print-mode\n  Scenario: Print-friendly theme\n    Given I am viewing content in any theme\n    When I trigger print mode\n    Then the content should switch to a print-optimized theme\n    And backgrounds should be removed or lightened\n    And text should be black on white for clarity\n    And unnecessary UI elements should be hidden\n\n  @theme @reduced-motion\n  Scenario: Respect reduced motion preferences\n    Given I have \"prefers-reduced-motion\" enabled\n    When I switch themes\n    Then transitions should be minimal or instant\n    And animations should be reduced or disabled\n    But functionality should remain intact\n\n  @theme @color-blind-support\n  Scenario Outline: Color blind accessibility\n    Given I have \"<color_blindness_type>\" color vision\n    When I use the application with different themes\n    Then information should not rely solely on color\n    And alternative visual cues should be present\n    And the typing interface should remain functional\n\n    Examples:\n      | color_blindness_type |\n      | protanopia          |\n      | deuteranopia        |\n      | tritanopia          |\n\n  @theme @performance\n  Scenario: Theme switching performance\n    Given I am on a page with many UI elements\n    When I switch themes multiple times quickly\n    Then each switch should complete within 300ms\n    And memory usage should not increase significantly\n    And the application should remain responsive\n\n  @theme @multi-tab-sync\n  Scenario: Theme synchronization across tabs\n    Given I have multiple tabs open\n    When I change the theme in one tab\n    Then all other tabs should update to match\n    And the change should propagate within 1 second\n    And no tab should show inconsistent theming\n\n  @theme @keyboard-control\n  Scenario: Keyboard control for theme switching\n    Given I am using keyboard navigation\n    When I press the theme toggle keyboard shortcut \"Ctrl+Shift+T\"\n    Then the theme should toggle\n    And focus should remain on the current element\n    When I tab to the theme toggle button\n    And press \"Enter\" or \"Space\"\n    Then the theme should also toggle",
