Feature: Comprehensive Typing Tutor Validation
  As a comprehensive testing framework
  I want to validate all typing tutor functionality
  So that I can ensure production readiness

  Background:
    Given I am on the typing tutor page
    And I can see the practice text
    And I can see the typing statistics showing 0 WPM and 100% accuracy

  Scenario: Basic typing functionality validation
    When I start typing the displayed text
    Then the characters I type correctly should be highlighted in green
    And the characters I type incorrectly should be highlighted in red
    And the current character position should be highlighted
    And the application should remain responsive

  Scenario: Real-time statistics calculation
    Given the practice text is "Hello World Test"
    When I type "Hello World Test" accurately
    Then the WPM should be calculated correctly
    And the accuracy should be 100%
    And the progress should show 100% completion

  Scenario: Error handling and correction
    Given the practice text is "Test Error Correction"
    When I type "Test Eror Correction" with errors
    And I use backspace to correct mistakes
    Then the highlighting should update correctly
    And the accuracy should recalculate properly
    And the error count should be accurate

  Scenario: Performance under load
    Given the practice text contains 500 characters
    When I type at maximum speed with 5ms intervals
    Then the application should remain responsive
    And all statistics should update correctly
    And no performance degradation should occur
    And memory usage should remain stable

  Scenario: Exercise completion workflow
    Given I have a complete typing exercise
    When I complete typing the entire text correctly
    Then a completion modal should appear
    And it should display my final WPM and accuracy
    And I should see options to try another exercise or close

  Scenario: Session persistence and reset
    Given I am in the middle of typing an exercise
    When I click the "Reset" button
    Then all input should be cleared
    And all statistics should reset to initial values
    And I should be able to start fresh with the same text

  Scenario: Multiple exercise navigation
    Given I have completed an exercise
    When I click "Next Exercise"
    Then a new practice text should be displayed
    And all statistics should reset to initial values
    And I should be able to start typing the new text

  Scenario: Edge case handling
    Given I have various edge case inputs
    When I type special characters and symbols
    Then the application should handle them correctly
    And the statistics should remain accurate
    And no errors should occur

  Scenario: Accessibility validation
    Given I am using keyboard navigation
    When I navigate through the application
    Then all interactive elements should be accessible
    And keyboard shortcuts should work correctly
    And screen reader support should be functional

  Scenario: Mobile responsiveness
    Given I am using a mobile device
    When I interact with the typing interface
    Then the layout should adapt correctly
    And touch interactions should work properly
    And the experience should remain optimal

  Scenario: Data validation and storage
    Given I have typing session data
    When I complete multiple exercises
    Then the data should be stored correctly
    And historical statistics should be maintained
    And data integrity should be preserved

  Scenario: Error recovery mechanisms
    Given an unexpected error occurs
    When the application encounters the error
    Then it should recover gracefully
    And provide helpful error messages
    And maintain application stability

  Scenario: Performance monitoring
    Given I am monitoring application performance
    When I run extended typing sessions
    Then CPU usage should remain reasonable
    And memory leaks should not occur
    And frame rates should stay consistent

  Scenario: Cross-browser compatibility
    Given I am using different browsers
    When I test the application functionality
    Then all features should work consistently
    And visual rendering should be correct
    And performance should be acceptable

  Scenario: Network resilience
    Given I have intermittent network connectivity
    When I use the application offline
    Then core functionality should continue working
    And data should sync when connection returns
    And user experience should not be interrupted
