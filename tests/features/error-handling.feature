    Given the application is running
    And error monitoring tools are configured
    And logging systems are active

    When JavaScript runtime errors occur
    Then errors should be caught and logged automatically
    And users should see a user-friendly error message
    And the application should not crash or become unresponsive
    And error details should be sent to error tracking service
    And users should be able to continue using other features
    And error recovery mechanisms should be triggered

  @error-handling @network @critical
  Scenario: Network Connection Errors
    Given I am using the application
    When network connectivity issues occur
    Then offline state should be detected and communicated to user
    And retry mechanisms should be attempted automatically (max 3 retries with exponential backoff)
    And cached content should be served when available
    And users should be notified when connection is restored
    And pending actions should be queued and retried
    And timeout errors should be handled gracefully (timeout: 30 seconds)

  @error-handling @api @critical
  Scenario: API Error Responses
    Given I am making API requests
    When the API returns error responses
    Then 4xx errors should display user-friendly messages
    And 5xx errors should trigger automatic retry with exponential backoff
    And error messages should be localized and helpful
    And sensitive error information should not be exposed to users
    And API timeouts should be handled (timeout: 30 seconds per request)
    And rate limiting errors (429) should trigger appropriate delays

  @error-handling @validation @high
  Scenario: Form Validation Errors
    Given I am filling out forms
    When validation errors occur
    Then error messages should appear immediately next to relevant fields
    And errors should be clearly visible and accessible
    And form submission should be prevented until errors are resolved
    And error messages should provide clear guidance for correction
    And field-level validation should occur on blur and change events
    And form state should be preserved during error correction

  @error-handling @typing-tutor @critical
  Scenario: Typing Exercise Error Recovery
    Given I am using the typing tutor
    When errors occur during the typing exercise
    Then exercise state should be preserved and recoverable
    And progress should not be lost due to temporary errors
    And performance metrics should continue to be tracked
    And users should be able to resume from the last valid state
    And error during keystroke recording should not break the exercise
    And connection loss should pause the exercise, not end it

  @error-handling @routing @high
  Scenario: Navigation and Routing Errors
    Given I am navigating through the application
    When routing errors occur
    Then 404 errors should display a helpful page with navigation options
    And users should be redirected to appropriate fallback pages
    And broken internal links should be automatically detected and reported
    And navigation history should be preserved where possible
    And breadcrumb navigation should remain functional
    And search functionality should be available on error pages

  @error-handling @authentication @critical
  Scenario: Authentication and Session Errors
    Given I am using authenticated features
    When authentication errors occur
    Then expired sessions should trigger graceful re-authentication prompts
    And users should be redirected to login without losing their current context
    And failed authentication should provide clear error messages
    And session restoration should be attempted automatically
    And user data should be preserved during authentication errors
    And permission errors should explain required access levels

  @error-handling @data-loading @high
  Scenario: Data Loading and Processing Errors
    Given I am viewing data-driven content
    When data loading errors occur
    Then loading states should be shown with appropriate timeouts
    And partial data should be displayed when available
    And retry options should be provided to users
    And skeleton screens should be used during loading
    And error states should offer manual refresh options
    And cached data should be used as fallback when appropriate

  @error-handling @resource @medium
  Scenario: Resource Loading Errors
    Given the application loads external resources
    When resource loading fails
    Then missing images should be replaced with placeholders
    And fallback fonts should be used when custom fonts fail
    And CSS/JS loading errors should not break core functionality
    And progressive enhancement should ensure basic functionality
    And resource loading should be retried with fallback CDNs
    And critical resources should have inline fallbacks

  @error-handling @boundary @critical
  Scenario: React Error Boundaries
    Given the application uses React components
    When component errors occur
    Then error boundaries should catch and contain errors
    And error fallback UI should be displayed for affected components
    And error details should be logged for debugging
    And unaffected components should continue to function
    And users should have options to retry or navigate away
    And error boundaries should be implemented at multiple levels

  @error-handling @global @critical
  Scenario: Global Error Handler
    Given the application has global error handling
    When any unhandled errors occur
    Then all errors should be caught by the global error handler
    And error reporting should include stack traces and context
    And user sessions should be preserved when possible
    And critical errors should trigger incident response
    And error frequency should be monitored and alerting configured
    And error patterns should be analyzed for proactive fixes

  @error-handling @recovery @high
  Scenario: Error Recovery and Resilience
    Given errors have occurred in the application
    When recovery mechanisms are triggered
    Then application state should be restored to a stable condition
    And users should be guided through recovery steps
    And data integrity should be maintained during recovery
    And recovery success rate should be >= 95%
    And recovery time should be <= 5 seconds for most errors
    And users should be informed about recovery progress

  @error-handling @monitoring @high
  Scenario: Error Monitoring and Alerting
    Given error monitoring is configured
    When errors occur in production
    Then errors should be tracked with unique identifiers
    And error rates should be monitored and alerted (threshold: >1% error rate)
    And critical errors should trigger immediate alerts
    And error trends should be analyzed for pattern detection
    And error context should include user agent, URL, and user actions
    And error resolution should be tracked and measured
