Feature: Comprehensive Performance Validation
  As a performance testing framework
  I want to validate application performance under all conditions
  So that I can ensure optimal user experience

  Scenario: Load testing with concurrent users
    Given I have 100 simulated concurrent users
    When they all start typing simultaneously
    Then response times should remain under 100ms
    And the server should handle all requests
    And no timeouts should occur

  Scenario: Memory leak detection
    Given I am monitoring memory usage
    When I run 50 consecutive typing sessions
    Then memory usage should not continuously increase
    And garbage collection should work effectively
    And no memory leaks should be detected

  Scenario: CPU usage optimization
    Given I am monitoring CPU performance
    When I perform intensive typing operations
    Then CPU usage should remain under 80%
    And the application should stay responsive
    And background processes should not interfere

  Scenario: Database performance validation
    Given I have a large dataset of exercises
    When I query for random exercises repeatedly
    Then query response times should be consistent
    And database connections should be managed properly
    And no connection leaks should occur

  Scenario: Rendering performance optimization
    Given I have complex UI elements
    When I perform rapid state updates
    Then frame rates should stay above 60 FPS
    And rendering should not cause jank
    And animations should be smooth

  Scenario: Network performance testing
    Given I have various network conditions
    When I simulate slow and fast connections
    Then the application should adapt appropriately
    And critical functionality should remain available
    And loading states should be handled gracefully

  Scenario: Storage performance validation
    Given I am using local storage extensively
    When I save and retrieve large amounts of data
    Then operations should complete quickly
    And storage limits should be respected
    And data consistency should be maintained

  Scenario: Bundle size optimization
    Given I am analyzing the application bundle
    When I measure the total bundle size
    Then it should be within acceptable limits
    And unnecessary dependencies should be excluded
    And code splitting should be effective

  Scenario: API performance testing
    Given I have multiple API endpoints
    When I make concurrent requests
    Then all endpoints should respond quickly
    And rate limiting should work correctly
    And error handling should be robust

  Scenario: Real-world performance simulation
    Given I simulate realistic user behavior
    When I perform typical user workflows
    Then the experience should be smooth
    And performance should meet user expectations
    And no bottlenecks should be apparent
