## Key Concepts

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Version control all infrastructure definitions
- Use Terraform for multi-cloud deployments
- Implement proper state management
- Modular and reusable components

### Deployment Strategies
- **Blue-Green**: Zero-downtime deployments with instant rollback
- **Canary**: Gradual traffic shift with monitoring
- **Rolling**: Sequential instance replacement
- **Feature Flags**: Runtime feature toggling

### Monitoring Philosophy
- **Four Golden Signals**: Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation
- **RED Method**: Rate, Errors, Duration
- **USE Method**: Utilization, Saturation, Errors
- **SLI/SLO**: Service Level Indicators and Objectives

### Container Best Practices
- Multi-stage builds for smaller images
- Non-root user execution
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Resource limits and requests
- Security scanning integration

## Production Readiness Checklist

### Security
- [ ] Container image vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Network policies implementation
- [ ] Secret management (not in code)
- [ ] RBAC configuration
- [ ] TLS everywhere
- [ ] Security monitoring and alerting

### Reliability
- [ ] Health checks configured
- [ ] Auto-scaling policies
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan
- [ ] Backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Circuit breakers and timeouts
- [ ] Graceful shutdown handling

### Observability
- [ ] Metrics collection and alerting
- [ ] Distributed tracing
- [ ] Centralized logging
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Business metrics tracking
- [ ] SLA/SLO monitoring

### Performance
- [ ] Load testing completed
- [ ] Resource optimization
- [ ] CDN configuration
- [ ] Database optimization
- [ ] Caching strategies
- [ ] Connection pooling

## Common Patterns

### 12-Factor App Principles
1. **Codebase**: One codebase tracked in revision control
2. **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
3. **Config**: Store config in the environment
4. **Backing Services**: Treat backing services as attached resources
5. **Build, Release, Run**: Strictly separate build and run stages
6. **Processes**: Execute as one or more stateless processes
7. **Port Binding**: Export services via port binding
8. **Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model
9. **Disposability**: Fast startup and graceful shutdown
10. **Dev/Prod Parity**: Keep development and production similar
11. **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams
12. **Admin Processes**: Run admin tasks as one-off processes

### GitOps Workflow

### Microservices Patterns
- **API Gateway**: Single entry point for clients
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic service location
- **Circuit Breaker**: Failure isolation
- **Bulkhead**: Resource isolation
- **Saga**: Distributed transaction management

## Tools and Technologies

### Container Orchestration
- **Kubernetes**: Production-grade orchestration
- **Docker Swarm**: Simple container clustering
- **Amazon ECS**: AWS-native container service
- **Google GKE**: Managed Kubernetes

### CI/CD Tools
- **GitHub Actions**: Git-native CI/CD
- **GitLab CI**: Integrated DevOps platform
- **Jenkins**: Extensible automation server
- **AWS CodePipeline**: AWS-native CI/CD

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform**: Multi-cloud infrastructure
- **AWS CloudFormation**: AWS-specific IaC
- **Pulumi**: Modern infrastructure as code
- **Ansible**: Configuration management

### Monitoring Stack
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards  
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing
- **ELK Stack**: Centralized logging

## Getting Started

### 1. Choose Your Platform
Start with your cloud provider or on-premises infrastructure requirements.

### 2. Container Strategy  
Containerize your application following best practices for security and performance.

### 3. Orchestration Setup
Choose between Kubernetes for complexity or Docker Swarm for simplicity.

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline
Implement automated testing, building, and deployment processes.

### 5. Monitoring Implementation
Set up observability with metrics, logging, and tracing before going to production.

### 6. Security Hardening
Implement security scanning, network policies, and secret management.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
- **Pod Stuck in Pending**: Check resource limits and node capacity
- **Image Pull Errors**: Verify registry access and credentials
- **Service Connectivity**: Check network policies and DNS resolution
- **High Memory Usage**: Review application memory leaks and limits
- **Slow Deployments**: Optimize build processes and image sizes

### Debugging Commands
```bash
# Kubernetes debugging
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous
kubectl get events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'

# Docker debugging
docker logs <container-id>
docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/bash
docker stats <container-id>

# System debugging
htop
iotop
netstat -tlnp
journalctl -u kubelet
```
