# Testing Strategy & Patterns

## Overview

This section provides comprehensive testing strategies for full-stack distributed systems, covering everything from unit tests to end-to-end validation, performance testing, and continuous integration.

## Testing Philosophy

**Test-First Development**: Write tests before implementation to drive design and ensure reliability.

**Testing Pyramid**: Balance test types for optimal coverage and feedback speed:
- Many fast unit tests (70%)
- Moderate integration tests (20%)  
- Few comprehensive E2E tests (10%)

**Quality Gates**: Every feature must pass all testing levels before deployment.

## Quick Start

```javascript
// Run all tests
pnpm test

// Run specific test suites
pnpm test:unit
pnpm test:integration
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm test:performance

// Watch mode for development
pnpm test:watch

// Coverage reporting
pnpm test:coverage
```
