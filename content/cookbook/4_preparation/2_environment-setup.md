## Environment Testing Protocol

### 30 Minutes Before Interview

1. **Network Test**
   ```bash
   # Test speed
   speedtest-cli
   
   # Test stability  
   ping -c 10 google.com
   ```

2. **Screen Share Test**
   - Join a test meeting
   - Share entire screen
   - Test switching between applications
   - Verify interviewer can see code clearly

3. **Code Environment Test**
   ```bash
   # Quick Node setup
   mkdir interview-test
   cd interview-test
   npm init -y
   npm i express
   
   # Test Express server
   echo 'const express = require("express"); const app = express(); app.get("/", (req, res) => res.send("ok")); app.listen(3000);' > test.js
   node test.js
   curl localhost:3000
   ```

4. **Browser Dev Tools**
   - F12 opens cleanly
   - Console, Network, Elements tabs accessible
   - No extension conflicts

## Interview Day Protocol

### 15 Minutes Before
- [ ] Close all unnecessary applications  
- [ ] Clear browser tabs except docs
- [ ] Restart computer if needed
- [ ] Test audio/video one final time
- [ ] Have water and snacks ready
- [ ] Turn off notifications

### 5 Minutes Before  
- [ ] Join the meeting early
- [ ] Test screen sharing again
- [ ] Confirm microphone and camera work
- [ ] Have backup contact info ready
- [ ] Take a deep breath and center yourself

## Coding Environment Template

### File Structure Ready

```
interview-workspace/
├── backend/
│   ├── package.json (with express)
│   ├── store.js (empty, ready to fill)
│   ├── toolkit.js (empty, ready to fill)  
│   └── app.js (basic Express setup)
├── frontend/
│   ├── package.json (Vue 3 setup)
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── useItems.js (empty)
│   │   └── App.vue (basic template)
├── docs/
│   └── cheatsheet.md (your reference notes)
```

### Quick Start Templates

**Backend (`app.js`)**:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.get('/health', (req, res) => res.send('ok'));

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on 3000'));
```

**Frontend (`src/App.vue`)**:
```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Interview App</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref, reactive, onMounted } from 'vue';
// Ready to implement
</script>
```

## Backup Plans

### Technical Issues
- **Internet fails**: Mobile hotspot + phone call backup
- **Computer crashes**: Backup laptop or tablet ready
- **Screen share breaks**: Fall back to code sharing via GitHub
- **Audio issues**: Phone call as backup audio

### Interview Flow Issues  
- **Blank out on syntax**: Have cheat sheet ready
- **Get stuck on approach**: Ask clarifying questions
- **Running out of time**: Focus on core functionality first
- **Interviewer asks unknown topic**: Be honest, show problem-solving process

## Mental Preparation

### Pre-Interview Routine (2 hours before)
1. **Light review**: Skim cheat sheets, don't deep study
2. **Physical prep**: Shower, comfortable clothes, light meal
3. **Relaxation**: 10 minutes of deep breathing or meditation  
4. **Positive visualization**: Imagine successful interview flow
5. **Energy management**: Light exercise or walk if nervous

### Confidence Builders
- **Practice runs**: Mock interviews with friends
- **Success reminders**: Recent coding accomplishments
- **Perspective**: This is a conversation, not an exam
- **Growth mindset**: Focus on learning, not perfect performance

## Interview Communication

### Screen Sharing Best Practices
- **Narrate actions**: "I'm opening VS Code to start coding"
- **Ask before switching**: "Should I show the terminal output?"
- **Check in regularly**: "Can you see the code clearly?"
- **Share thoughtfully**: Only show relevant windows

### Code Presentation
- **Font size**: 16pt+ for readability
- **Clean workspace**: Close irrelevant files/tabs
- **Logical flow**: Code top to bottom when possible
- **Comments**: Add brief explanations for complex logic

## Emergency Contacts

Have these ready during the interview:
- **Recruiting contact**: Phone and email
- **IT support**: If company provides technical help
- **Personal backup**: Someone who can help with emergencies
- **Backup interview platform**: Zoom, Meet, Teams accounts ready

## Post-Interview Protocol

### Immediate (within 5 minutes)
- [ ] Save all code written during interview
- [ ] Note any questions you couldn't answer
- [ ] Write brief reflection on what went well/poorly
- [ ] Send thank you note if appropriate

### Within 24 Hours
- [ ] Review any topics you struggled with  
- [ ] Update your preparation materials based on experience
- [ ] Follow up with recruiter if requested
- [ ] Plan next steps regardless of outcome

The goal is to eliminate all technical friction so you can focus entirely on demonstrating your coding and communication skills.
