## Quick Reference

### Emergency Response Checklist

```javascript
// 1. Assess Impact
const assessImpact = () => ({
  usersAffected: 'How many users are impacted?',
  severity: 'Is this critical, high, medium, or low?',
  businessImpact: 'What business functions are affected?'
});

// 2. Stabilize System
const stabilizeSystem = () => ({
  rollback: 'Can we rollback to last known good state?',
  circuitBreaker: 'Should we enable circuit breakers?',
  scalingAction: 'Do we need to scale resources?'
});

// 3. Investigate
const investigate = () => ({
  logs: 'Check application and system logs',
  metrics: 'Review performance metrics',
  traces: 'Analyze distributed traces'
});
```

### Debugging Mindset

- **Stay Calm**: Panic leads to mistakes
- **Reproduce First**: If you can't reproduce it, you can't fix it
- **Divide and Conquer**: Isolate the problem space
- **Question Assumptions**: Recent changes aren't always the cause
- **Document Everything**: Your future self will thank you

## Best Practices

1. **Implement Comprehensive Logging**
2. **Use Structured Error Handling**
3. **Monitor Key Metrics**
4. **Practice Chaos Engineering**
5. **Maintain Runbooks**
6. **Regular Fire Drills**

## Tools & Technologies

- **APM**: New Relic, Datadog, AppDynamics
- **Logging**: ELK Stack, Fluentd, Splunk
- **Tracing**: Jaeger, Zipkin, AWS X-Ray
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry, Bugsnag, Rollbar

Remember: Every problem is an opportunity to improve system resilience and team knowledge.
