Interviewing
at Qualia
THANK YOU!
Thank you for taking the time to interview with Qualia! We care deeply about your experience
and are always looking for ways to improve our process. At the end of your interview experience
with us, you’ll receive a short survey to share your thoughts. We welcome your candid feedback
and suggestions.
ABOUT QUALIA
At Qualia, we’ve built the leading B2B real estate technology that transforms the home buying and
selling experience into a simple, secure, and enjoyable process. Our SMB and Enterprise products
bring together users from across the real estate ecosystem---homebuyers and sellers, lenders, title
and escrow agents, and real estate agents---onto a single shared digital closing platform, providing
greater clarity and transparency to real estate transactions. Today, through our business customers
across the country, millions of consumers use Qualia to close on homes every year.
ENGINEERING AT QUALIA
Structured for Impact & Agility
At Qualia, our engineering organization is built for impact and agility. You'll join one of eight
dedicated product teams, each taking full ownership of an individual product and supported by
specialized QA and infrastructure teams. These focused groups, typically 5-10 engineers led by an
engineering manager, collaborate closely with dedicated product managers and designers. This
close-knit structure, combined with a rapid weekly release cycle, empowers you to see your work
come to life quickly and make a tangible difference.
Dedicated to Your Growth & Development
We are deeply invested in your growth at Qualia, fostering this through integrated and
multifaceted mentorship. You'll benefit from diverse knowledge-sharing channels, including
engaging weekly engineering talks that explore a wide array of topics and encourage learning
from varied perspectives. As we scale, ensuring multiple avenues for team interaction and mutual
learning remains a priority. A cornerstone of our developmental approach is strategic code
reviews; these reciprocal reviews between junior and senior engineers are designed to accelerate
learning, cultivate new skills, and unify our team as we tackle complex challenges together.
Empowering Culture of Ownership & Collaboration
Our engineering culture is designed to empower you. You'll experience significant autonomy,
access to advanced tooling, and true ownership throughout the entire product lifecycle – from
initial concept to daily deployment. This dynamic environment thrives on deep collaboration
across all departments, especially with Product and Design, fostering open knowledge sharing and
a comprehensive understanding of customer needs. Continuous learning is integral, supported by
insightful educational talks and a talented, yet humble team dedicated to mutual growth as we
conquer complex challenges. Our flat organizational structure ensures accessible leadership and
empowers you to focus on impactful work, all within a culture that champions high emotional
intelligence (EQ > IQ), kindness, and a shared passion for transforming the real estate experience.
INTERVIEW PROCESS
Our interview process is designed to assess your practical engineering skills, technical versatility,
depth, and your approach to full-stack web development. You'll encounter tasks that mirror real-
world product development, which may involve building interactive user interfaces, working with
data, and applying logical problem-solving. A solid understanding of full-stack web technologies will
be valuable throughout the process.
If you find yourself stuck on a problem, your interviewers are there to help and can provide hints to
guide your thinking—the goal is to understand your problem-solving approach, so please
communicate your thought process. Remember, how you navigate challenges and articulate your
reasoning is as important as reaching a final solution.
Important Guidelines for Technical Interviews:
Documentation and Resources: Our interviews are generally ‘open-book,
’ meaning you can
consult documentation. However, we ask that you refrain from searching for solutions to the
specific interview problem itself.
Code Completion Tools: Standard code completion tools (e.g., VS Code Intellisense) are
permitted. Please disable any advanced AI-assisted code completion tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot,
Tabnine, Claude Code, etc.) during the technical exercises.
Screen Sharing & Internet: To ensure a fair and consistent process, please be prepared to share
your entire screen during the technical coding challenges. A stable internet connection is
imperative for a smooth interview experience.
Video Interview Environment: For all video interviews, we require candidates to use a real,
unfiltered background without any blurring. Please choose a background you are comfortable
with; this helps create a more authentic engaging conversation.
Technical Phone Interview: 60-minutes
This 60-minute interview includes a 10-15 minute discussion about your recent projects and
experience, followed by a 40-minute hands-on coding exercise. You’ll complete this exercise in
your own development environment, sharing your screen via Google Meet. You are encouraged to
use familiar tools and online resources (like Google) as you normally would, keeping in mind the
“Important Guidelines for Technical Interviews” mentioned earlier.
You’ll complete one of two coding challenges described below. Both challenges focus on solving
real-world problems rather than algorithmic, LeetCode-style puzzles. Since we determine the
specific challenge after scheduling your interview, please come prepared for either format.
Format 1: Frontend Coding Challenge
In this challenge, you’ll build a small web application (only one screen) using your preferred
frontend framework.
Preparation Requirements:
Set up a local development environment with a starter project.
Be prepared to share your entire screen during the interview.
Have your preferred frontend framework ready (e.g., using React, Angular, Vue, Svelte,
plain HTML/JavaScript, etc).
We recommend using a bootstrapping tool like Vite for quick setup. However, feel free to
choose the technology stack that best demonstrates your skills.
Format 2: Backend Optimization Challenge
This challenge requires no advanced tooling preparation.
Receive a URL to access in your web browser.
Use a web-based code editor to complete the exercise.
Work with existing code that has performance issues and/or bugs.
Optimize and fix the provided code to meet the specified requirements.
Please note: Your performance in this Technical Phone Interview will be thoroughly evaluated.
Successful completion and a positive assessment are prerequisites for advancing to the Virtual
Onsite Interview stage.
Virtual Onsite Interview: 3.5-4 hours
The Virtual Onsite Interview is a comprehensive session lasting approximately 3.5-4 hours, which
includes at least one half-hour break. This stage involves two technical challenges and two non-
technical interviews designed to thoroughly assess your skills and experience. Please note that the
specific composition of your interview panel may be subject to change.
Again, you’ll be completing these exercises in your own development environment, sharing your
screen via Google Meet. You are encouraged to use your familiar tools and online resources (like
Google) as you normally would, keeping in mind the "Important Guidelines for Technical
Interviews" mentioned earlier.
Coding Exercise Specifics:
Tasks: You may be asked to build web applications or features from scratch, or to diagnose and
extend existing code. Tasks can range from developing user interface and managing application
state to interacting with APIs (which may be provided or mocked) and considering data
persistence.
Preparation: Have your preferred frontend framework ready (e.g., using React, Angular, Vue,
Svelte, plain HTML/JavaScript, etc).
Focus: Focus is on applying your full-stack web development skills to practical problems,
emphasizing your design approach, cross-stack implementation, and ability to navigate complex
challenges.
Data Handling: Expect tasks involving API interaction (using provided, public, or mocked APIs)
and data persistence strategies. Understanding data flow, API usage, and persistence concepts
is key; live database setup is not required.
Objective: The objective is to assess your coding abilities (weighted most heavily), critical
thinking, communication, and collaboration.
Progression Review:
After the first two technical interviews, your performance will be evaluated by the team. A
positive assessment in these initial sessions is required to advance to the remaining interviews
in the onsite loop
Final Interviews (if progressing):
This stage includes two non-technical interviews.
Non-technical interviews focus on: working style, past projects, and cross-functional
experience.
WHAT TO EXPECT
Please come prepared to discuss your previous technical projects, your current role and team
dynamics, and your experiences collaborating with non-technical team members. Your interviewers
will typically include engineers you might work alongside, engineering managers, and potentially
team members from product or other closely collaborating departments. We value thoughtful and
curious engineers, so we encourage you to ask questions throughout the interviews to help you
learn about us as well
Qualia is committed to providing an accessible and inclusive interview experience. If you require
any accommodations to participate fully, please discuss this with your recruiter beforehand so we
can make the necessary arrangements.
To respect everyone's time, the onsite interview may conclude earlier than the scheduled duration
if the interview team believes they have gathered sufficient information to make an informed
decision. This is a standard part of our process and is not indicative of the interview outcome. Your
recruiter will follow up promptly after the interview, and you can expect to hear about our decision
typically within 48 hours.
