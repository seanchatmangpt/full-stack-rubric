Of course. I will refactor the project structure to follow the more detailed pattern you've provided, which is characteristic of a production-grade Nuxt UI Pro Docs template.

The structure below represents the cookbook-site portion of our project, now organized with the source code inside an app/ directory and config files at the root. The mock-api/ server would be a sibling directory to this structure in the complete monorepo.

"Cracking the Qualia Interview" Project Structure (Revised)
Here is the complete project structure, applying the requested pattern to our cookbook content.

Explanation of Changes to Match the Pattern:
app/ Directory: All Nuxt source files (components, pages, layouts, etc.) are now nested inside the app/ directory as requested. app.config.ts for theme configuration also lives here.

Root Config Files: nuxt.config.ts, package.json, and tsconfig.json are now at the project root, sibling to the app/ directory.

Content Numbering: The content/ directory structure has been updated to use numeric prefixes for ordering (e.g., 1.rubric, 2.patterns). Individual files within these directories also use numeric prefixes (e.g., 1.index.md, 2.technical-skills.md) to ensure predictable navigation order, which is a best practice for Nuxt Content.

Server Routes: The server routes are placed in server/routes/ which is the conventional location in Nuxt 3. I've included our api/items.get.ts proxy route here, as well as a raw/[...].ts placeholder from your example pattern.

mock-api/ Location: The mock-api server is shown as a sibling directory at the root level. This maintains the decoupled architecture while structuring the Nuxt application according to the new, more detailed pattern.


Dissecting the User Request

I'm initially taking the user's request apart. The prompt is open, which means I'll need to define what makes a PRD "new." This could involve looking at past PRDs and pinpointing areas for improvement. Considering the vague nature of the prompt, I'll need to ask for more specifics to understand the intended direction.

Building Upon Existing Ideas

I'm now starting to consider concrete ideas for a "new" PRD. Based on our past discussions and the user's focus, I'm leaning toward expanding the "cookbook" concept. I'm exploring turning it into a SaaS platform where users can create and share interview prep materials across various companies. Another direction I'm considering is an AI-powered mock interview simulator that takes the cookbook content to the next level by offering real-time feedback and evaluation.

Analyzing the Most Viable Idea

I'm now focusing on Idea B, the AI-powered Mock Interview Simulator, as the most compelling direction. This build on our assets and the rubric with real-time feedback and evaluation capabilities. It's a clear, focused product with a strong value proposition, which aligns with the user's focus on interview preparation. The next steps will involve structuring a professional PRD around this concept.

Refining the Product Concept

I've narrowed my focus to the AI-Powered Mock Interview Simulator (Idea B). I'm framing it as "Interview Copilot," an AI agent leveraging our established cookbook content. I'm actively structuring the PRD, starting with a problem definition emphasizing the limitations of passive learning and the need for realistic, immediate feedback. Key goals include measurable engagement, confidence improvement, and conversion rates, all tailored to the user's focus. I'm now drafting the introduction and will continue to flesh out the solution.

Developing the Product Scope

I'm structuring the core of the PRD now, focusing on the AI-powered simulator, provisionally named "Interview Copilot". The key features include interactive drills from our cookbook, AI-driven guidance, and real-time feedback. I'm prioritizing user stories within the "Simulation Core" epic, ensuring a seamless and valuable user experience.

Focusing on Product Goals

I've been working on refining the product goals for "Interview Copilot." I'm now aiming for quantifiable metrics like a target increase in user confidence and the desired conversion rate from free to paid. These goals will act as a compass for development, ensuring we're delivering a product that users love and are willing to pay for. I'm also adding in additional metrics.

Finalizing Product Strategy

I'm now fully immersed in the PRD creation.  I've chosen "Interview Copilot" as the official name, and I'm fleshing out the 'Simulation Core' epic, including user stories around interactive drills and real-time feedback. I'm also planning the feedback loop. The document is shaping up to be comprehensive and compelling.

Of course. Building on our previous work with the cookbook, here is a new PRD for a logical next-generation product: an AI-powered mock interview simulator that uses our cookbook content as its brain.

PRD: Interview Copilot - AI-Powered Mock Interview Simulator
Status: Draft

Author: Gemini

Date: September 5, 2025

Version: 1.0

1. Introduction
1.1 Problem
The "Cracking the Interview" cookbook provides candidates with the exact patterns and knowledge needed to succeed. However, knowledge alone is insufficient. The primary challenge of a technical interview is performing under pressure, articulating a coherent thought process, and writing clean code in a timed, interactive setting. There is no scalable, on-demand way for candidates to practice this live performance loop safely. Human coaching is expensive and difficult to schedule, while solo practice lacks the critical feedback element.

1.2 Solution
We will build Interview Copilot, an AI-powered mock interview simulator. Interview Copilot will leverage the content from our cookbook (rubrics, patterns, and drills) to act as a realistic, automated interviewer. It will guide users through timed drills in a simulated environment, featuring a chat interface and an integrated code editor. After the session, it will provide instant, objective feedback on both the user's code and their communication, scored directly against our reverse-engineered rubric.

1.3 Goals
Engagement: Achieve an average of 2 completed simulations per active user in their first week.

Confidence: Increase user-reported interview confidence by at least 25% after three completed simulations (measured via pre- and post-use surveys).

Efficacy: Achieve a 4.5/5.0 average user rating on the perceived quality and accuracy of the AI-generated feedback.

Monetization (Post-V1): Convert 5% of free users to a paid tier within 6 months of public launch.

1.4 Non-Goals
This is not a replacement for a full IDE or a local development environment.

It will not provide live voice or video analysis in V1; interaction is text-based chat and code.

It does not guarantee a job offer. It is a practice tool.

It will not cover esoteric "puzzle" questions, focusing exclusively on the practical drills defined in the cookbook.

2. User Personas
Alex, the Mid-Level Applicant: Alex has used the cookbook and understands the patterns, but she's anxious about thinking on her feet. She wants to rehearse the entire interview flow—from greeting to coding to explaining tradeoffs—to build muscle memory and reduce performance anxiety. She needs a sparring partner.

Maria, the Career Changer: Maria is transitioning into tech from another field. She has the coding skills from a bootcamp but has almost no real-world interview experience. She is insecure about "sounding like an engineer" and needs a safe, private space to fail, learn from feedback, and practice articulating her thought process.

3. Features & Requirements
Epic 1: The Core Simulation Experience
The user-facing environment for conducting the mock interview.

REQ-1.1: As a user, I can browse the drills from the cookbook and select one to begin a timed simulation session.

REQ-1.2: The simulation interface must feature three panels: an AI interviewer chat window, a text-based code editor pre-configured for the exercise, and a live preview or terminal output panel.

REQ-1.3: The AI Interviewer must guide the session via chat, starting with an introduction, presenting the problem, and offering clarifying hints (if requested) based on the cookbook's simulation transcripts.

REQ-1.4: The code editor must be connected to the existing mock-api, allowing the user's code to make real HTTP requests during the simulation.

REQ-1.5: As a user, I can "run" my code at any time to see the output and "submit" it for final review.

Epic 2: The AI Feedback Engine
The core intelligence that provides post-session analysis.

REQ-2.1: When a simulation is submitted, the AI must analyze the final code against the specific patterns and solutions outlined in the cookbook.

REQ-2.2: The AI will score the code submission against the technical dimensions of the cookbook's rubric (e.g., Correctness, Code Structure, Pattern Usage).

REQ-2.3: The AI will analyze the user's chat transcript to evaluate their communication, scoring it against the non-technical dimensions of the rubric (e.g., Problem Decomposition, Tradeoff Articulation).

REQ-2.4: The feedback must be constructive, referencing specific lines of code and chat messages, and suggesting improvements by pointing to relevant patterns in the cookbook.

Epic 3: User Performance Dashboard
A personalized space for users to track their improvement.

REQ-3.1: As a user, after each simulation, I can view a detailed performance report with my scores broken down by rubric category.

REQ-3.2: The report must include the full transcript of the interview with the AI's feedback presented inline.

REQ-3.3: As a user, I can view a dashboard that tracks my average scores over time, highlighting areas of strength and weakness.
